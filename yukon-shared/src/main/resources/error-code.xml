        <troubleshooting>
            This is a bulk communications error typically associated with systems using direct radio
            communications between the master station and a targeted device such as a CCU, RTU or
            dial up meter.
            Communication timing setup usually plays a role in troubleshooting this problem.

        <description>The response's sequence number does not match what was expected by the master
            station.</description>
        <troubleshooting>
            This is a bulk communications error that is typically associated with invalid timing
            parameter's set at the master station. Another possible cause is a field visit to the
            CCU
            resulting in local communications being used. Upon setting the communications back to internal, the master
            station may receive this error on the first request due internal bookkeeping mismatches.
            The
            master station will automatically recovery from this internal mismatch.

            This is a data validation error associated with the frozen peak demand's timestamp

            This range is defined as greater than the last frozen peak demand reading archived in the database
            and less than the timestamp of the most recent freeze command sent to the device.
            This error typically occurs if the device missed an attempted freeze of the registers.
