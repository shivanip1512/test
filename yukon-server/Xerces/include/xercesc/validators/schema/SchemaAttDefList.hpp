//  This is a derivative of the framework abstract class which defines the
//  interface to a list of attribute defs that belong to a particular
//  element. The scanner needs to be able to get a list of the attributes
//  that an element supports, for use during the validation process and for
//  fixed/default attribute processing.
//
//  For us, we just wrap the RefHash2KeysTableOf collection that the SchemaElementDecl
//  class uses to store the attributes that belong to it.
//
//  This class does not adopt the hash table, it just references it. The
//  hash table is owned by the element decl it is a member of.
