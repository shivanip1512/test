        A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating
        for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the
        modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible
        to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages
        and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other less-developed parts of the world.

        Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, parking, and passenger comfort and
        safety. New controls have also been added to vehicles, making them more complex. Examples include air conditioning, navigation systems, and in car entertainment. Most cars in use today are
        propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by deflagration of gasoline (also known as petrol) or diesel. Both fuels are known to cause air pollution and are also blamed for contributing to
        climate change and global warming. Vehicles using alternative fuels such as ethanol flexible-fuel vehicles and natural gas vehicles are also gaining popularity in some countries.

        Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel,
        depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance, are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of the benefits - perceived and real - of vehicle usage. The
        benefits may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience. The costs to society of encompassing car use, which may include those of: maintaining roads, land use,
        pollution, public health, health care, and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life, can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates. The societal
        benefits may include: economy benefits, such as job and wealth creation, of car production and maintenance, transportation provision, society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel
        opportunities, and revenue generation from the tax opportunities. The ability for humans to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching implications for the nature of societies.

        The term motorcar has formerly also been used in the context of electrified rail systems to denote a car which functions as a small locomotive but also provides space for passengers and baggage. These
        locomotive cars were often used on suburban routes by both interurban and intercity railroad systems. It was estimated in 2010 that the number of cars had risen to over 1 billion vehicles, up from
        the 500 million of 1986. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and other NICs.

        A truck (United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, also called a lorry in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo. Trucks vary
        greatly in size, power, and configuration, with the smallest being mechanically similar to an automobile. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful, and may be configured to mount
        specialized equipment, such as in the case of fire trucks and concrete mixers and suction excavators.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern trucks are largely powered by diesel engines exclusively, although small to medium size
        trucks with gasoline engines exist in the US. In the European Union, vehicles with a gross combination mass of up to 3,500 kilograms (7,716 lb) are known as light commercial vehicles, and those
        over as large goods vehicles.

        An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a
        variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Most airplanes are
        flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.
    </p>

        In 1799, Sir George Cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane. He was building and
        flying models of fixed-wing aircraft in 1803, and he built a successful passenger-carrying glider in 1853. Between 1867 and 1896 the German pioneer of human aviation Otto Lilienthal developed
        heavier-than-air flight. The Wright brothers flights in 1903 are recognized as "the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight". Following WWI, aircraft technology continued
        to develop. Airplanes had a presence in all the major battles of World War II. The first jet aircraft was the German Heinkel He 178 in 1939. The first jet airliner, the de Havilland Comet, was
        introduced in 1952. The Boeing 707, the first widely successful commercial jet, was in commercial service for more than 50 years, from 1958 to 2010.
