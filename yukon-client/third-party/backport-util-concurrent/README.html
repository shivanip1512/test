<p>
This package is the backport of 
<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/concurrency-interest/">java.util.concurrent</a> API, 
introduced in 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/concurrency/overview.html">Java 5.0</a>,
to Java 1.4. The backport is based on public-domain sources from the
<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/main/java/">
JSR 166 CVS repository</a>, and the
<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">
dl.util.concurrent</a> package.
The backport is nearly complete; unsupported functionality is 
limited mostly to the following cases: 1) things that require explicit 
JVM support, 2) some non-essential functions 
described in the original javadoc as "designed primarily for use in 
monitoring in system state, not for synchronization control", 3) 
functionality which emulation would affect performance, or 4) functionality 
that would require development of substantial amount of new code.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this library is to enable gradual transition from Java 1.4 
to 5.0: the library allows to develop concurrent applications for Java 1.4 
that should work with Java 5.0 simply by changing package names.

<h4>Feb 7, 2004</h4>
The backport, version 1.1_01, has been released. New release fixes
a bug affecting fair reentrant lock and several dependent classes. 
Additionally, starting with this version, the library is stress-tested 
using the "loop" tests
from the JSR 166 package. See the changelog, below, for more information.

<h4>Feb 7, 2004</h4>
Courtesy of Doug Lea and the JSR 166 Expert Group, the
<a href="http://altair.cs.oswego.edu/mailman/listinfo/concurrency-interest">Concurrency-Interest mailing list</a>
can be now used as a discussion forum for this library. When posting a comment, 
please clearly indicate if your message regards the backport rather than the original
JSR 166 API. I suggest prefixing the subject line with "backport: ".

<h4>Jan 21, 2004</h4>
The backport, version 1.1, has been released. An important bug
was fixed, and some new functionality was added. Users of
1.1_01 are urged to upgrade. See the changelog, below,
for more information.

<h4>Dec 28, 2004</h4>
The backport, version 1.0_01, has been released. A few bugs have
been fixed since 1.0, and some new functionality was added. See the
changelog, below, for more information. 

<h4>Dec 1, 2004</h4>
The backport, version 1.0, has been released. It is based
on JSR 166 sources as of Jan 14, 2004, and dl.util.concurrent 1.3.4.

<p>
The following list enumerates the functionality of java.util.concurrent
that is included in this backport:
<ul>
<li>All JSR 166 executors, utilities, and everything related (thread pools, 
FutureTask, scheduled tasks and executors, etc.)</li>
<li>Locks: ReentrantLock, Semaphore, ReentrantReadWriteLock (see remarks 
below), Conditions</li>
<li>Queues: synchronous, array, linked, delay, and priority queues</li>
<li>Deques: array, and linked deques</li>
<li>Atomics: everything except reflection-based updaters</li>
<li>Other concurrency utils: CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier</li>
<li>Collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<em>Note on package naming:</em> since user libraries cannot define classes in
java.* packages, all the original package names have been prefixed with
<code>edu.emory.mathcs.backport</code>. For instance, <code>java.util.concurrent.Future</code> becomes <code>edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.Future</code>.
</p>
<p><em>Compatibility:</em> The backport, version 1.1 and above, includes some 
functionality of JSR 166 (deques, "allowCoreThreadTimeOut" in ThreadPoolExecutor etc.)
that did not make it for Java 5.0, but which is scheduled for addition in the next 
Java release. Pay attention to the "since" javadoc tags if conformance with specific 
Java platform versions is desired.

<p>
The library passes 1091 tests from 
<a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/test/tck/">TCK test package</a>
designed for java.util.concurrent (the tests of unsupported functionality 
were skipped).
</p>
<p>
The following classes were unit-tested (listed in the alphabetical order):
AbstractExecutorServiceTest, 
AbstractQueueTest, 
ArrayBlockingQueueTest, 
ArrayDequeTest, 
AtomicBooleanTest, 
AtomicIntegerArrayTest, 
AtomicIntegerTest, 
AtomicLongArrayTest,

</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><strong>New: </strong></font> version 1.1_01 of the 
backport has been stress-tested using the "loops" tests from JSR 166 
(courtesy of Doug Lea and the JSR 166 Expert Group). The tests, included 
in the development source 
bundle, thoroughly evaluate behavior and performance of various types 
of locks, queues, maps, futures, and other API classes, under various 
conditions (contention etc.) and circumstances, including cancellation.
The backport has withstood days of testing on Windows XP, Linux, 
and Solaris (SMP), running up to 400 concurrent threads. 
</p>
<p>
In addition, it is important to emphasize that vast proportion of the backport
is based on source code from JSR 166 and dl.util.concurrent, both very 
well tested. Whenever possible, the JSR 166 code was used. In cases when 
it was infeasible (e.g. the JSR 166 code had strong dependencies on 
native JVM support), the dl.util.concurrent code was adapted. The new 
code was introduced only when absolutely necessary, e.g. to make 
dl.util.concurrent code conforming to JSR 166 interfaces and semantics.
</p>
<p>
However, as any software, this library may still contain bugs. If you find 
one, please report it, or better yet, contribute a fix.

<tr>
<p>
Detailed discussion of functionality that has not been backported
is presented below.
</p>

<h4>Java 5.0 Syntax</h4>
<p>
Package java.util.concurrent exploits new language features
added to Java in release 5.0: most API classes are
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/generics.html">generic types</a>.
In the backport, they had to be flattened to standard, non-generic 
classes. Still, programs linked against the backport should compile 
with Java 5.0 (after changing package names). Nevertheless, you may 
want to consider gradually switching to using generics once you make 
the transition to Java 5.0, since it gives better compile-time 
type checking.
</p>

<h4>In Condition</h4>
<p>
Method long awaitNanos(long nanosTimeout) is not supported, since the
emulation cannot reliably report remaining times with nanosecond 
precision. Thus, it probably would be too dangerous to leave the
emulated method in the Condition interface. However, the method is
still available, for those who know what they are doing,
in the <a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/helpers/Utils.html">util.concurrent.helpers.Utils</a> class.
</p>

<h4>In ReentrantLock</h4>
<p>
The following monitoring methods are not supported: boolean 
hasWaiters(Condition), int getWaitQueueLength(Condition), Collection 
getWaitingThreads(Condition).
</p>
<p>
the following monitoring methods are supported only for fair locks: 
boolean hasQueuedThreads(), int getQueueLength(), Collection 
getQueuedThreads(), boolean isQueued().
</p>

<h4>In ReentrantReadWriteLock</h4>
<p>
The current backport implementation is based on dl.util.concurrent class
ReentrantWriterPreferenceReadWriteLock, and thus slightly departs
from java.util.concurrent that does not specify acquisition order but 
allows to enable/disable fairness. The backport implementation does not 
have a single-parameter constructor allowing to specify fairness policy; 
it always behaves like writer-preference lock with no fairness guarantees.
Because of these characteristics, this class is compliant with JSR 166 
specification of non-fair reentrant read-write locks, while the exact 
semantics of fair locks are not supported (and the appropriate 
constructor is thus not provided).
</p>
<p>
Also, the following instrumentation and status methods are not 
supported: Collection getQueuedWriterThreads(), Collection 
getQueuedReaderThreads(), boolean hasQueuedThreads(), boolean 
hasQueuedThread(Thread), Collection getQueuedThreads(), boolean 
hasWaiters(Condition), int getWaitQueueLength(Condition), Collection 
getWaitingThreads(Condition).
</p>

<h4>In Semaphore</h4>
<p>
Atomic multi-acquires: tryAcquire(int permits) and tryAcquire(int 
permits, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) are not supported.
</p>

<h4>Platform-level functionality</h4>
<p>
To emulate System.nanoTime(), the method 
<a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/helpers/Utils.html#nanoTime()">nanoTime()</a> 
is provided in the class 
dl.util.concurrent.helpers.Utils. On Java 1.4.2, it attempts to use
high-precision timer via sun.misc.Perf (thanks to Craig Mattocks
for suggesting this). On older Java platforms, or when sun.misc.Perf
is not supported, it falls back to System.currentTimeMillis().
</p>
<p>
Class <a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/helpers/ThreadHelpers.html">ThreadHelpers</a>
(added in 1.0_01) is provided to emulate certain aspects of Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.
</p>

<h4>Note on nanosecond precision timing</h4>
<p>
The backport strives to honor nanosecond timeouts, if such are requested, 
by using two-parameter variant of Object.wait(). Note, however, that most 
Java platforms before 5.0 will round up the timeout to full milliseconds 
anyway.
</p>

<h4>Low-level concurrency classes</h4>
<p>
The following classes are not supported: 
LockSupport, AbstractQueuedSynchronizer. 
</p><p><i>Rationale: </i> on Java 5.0, these classes depend on explicit
JVM support, delegating to low-level OS concurrency primitives. There seems
to be no simple way of emulating them without introducing prohibitive 
performance overhead. (If you think they should be present in the backport
anyway, let me know).
</p>

<h4>Atomic utilities</h4>
<p>
The following "atomic" utilities are not supported: 
Atomic[Integer,Long,Reference]FieldUpdater.

</p>

<h4>Collections</h4>
<p>
JSR 166 introduces a few improvements to core collection classes, such as 
Tree[Map,Set], AbstractMap, LinkedList, and Collections. For instance, 
LinkedList now implements Deque, and TreeSet is now navigable. I have been
hesitant to include these classes in the backport, mainly because of the
fear of breaking compile-time backward compatibility. Namely, ambiguities
would arise from importing both java.util.* and ..backport.java.util.*.
However, I am having second thoughts on this, since navigable sets are
actually pretty useful. Opinions in this matter are greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>
The following concurrent collection classes are not yet supported: 
ConcurrentLinkedQueue, ConcurrentSkipList[Map,Set]. They will most likely be 
added in future releases.

Version 1.1_01 (Feb 7, 2005) [<a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/dcl/util/backport-util-concurrent/dist/backport-util-concurrent-1.1_01/backport-util-concurrent-1.1_01-changelog.html">CVS log</a>]
<ul>
<li>Bugfix: race condition in the fair implementation of ReentrantLock 
caused it to occassionally cause IllegalMonitorState exceptions. Non-fair
implementation was not affected, however, classes that depend on fair reentrant locks,
namely: fair ArrayBlockingQueue, fair SynchronousQueue, and PriorityQueue, were
affected.
Thanks to Ramesh Nethi for reporting this bug and helping to track it down.</li>

<li>Testing: backport has been stress-tested using the "loops" tests
(courtesy of Doug Lea and the JSR 166 Expert Group). The tests
are included in the development source bundle.</li>
</ul>

Version 1.1 (Jan 21, 2005) [<a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/dcl/util/backport-util-concurrent/dist/backport-util-concurrent-1.1/backport-util-concurrent-1.1-changelog.html">CVS log</a>]
<ul>
<li>Bugfix: on Windows platforms with Java 1.4.2, the library
were sometimes behaving as if timeouts were ignored or misinterpreted,
typically resulting in indefinite waits. This resulted from an internal
timer overflow that occurred every several hours, and was also manifested
as a discontinuity in System.nanoTime() values. The problem would happen
if the overflow occurred during blocked timed wait, if additionally
a spurious wakeup occurred after the overflow but before timeout
in the underlying Object.wait().
This has now been fixed; 1.0_01 users are urged to upgrade to version 1.1.
Thanks to Ramesh Nethi for reporting this bug and greatly contributing
to tracking it down.</li>

<li>Feature: backport has been reconciled with JSR 166 CVS repository
    on Jan 14, 2005. This results in a handful of new things:
    <ul>
    <li>New 
        <a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html">time units</a>: 
        MINUTES, HOURS, and DAYS.</li>
    <li><a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html#allowCoreThreadTimeOut(boolean)">allowCoreThreadTimeOut</a>
        in ThreadPoolExecutor, which enables <em>bounded</em>
        pools that kills threads if they are idle for too long.</li>
    <li>ThreadPoolExecutor now handles excessive interruption requests more gracefully 
        (previously, it was reported to be able to crash older JVMs).</li>
    <li><a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/Deque.html">Deques</a>.</li>
    <li>Javadoc improvements.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>

Version 1.0_01 (Dec 28, 2004) [<a href="http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/dcl/util/backport-util-concurrent/dist/backport-util-concurrent-1.0_01/backport-util-concurrent-1.0_01-changelog.html">CVS log</a>]
<ul>
<li>Feature: development source bundle with ant scripts allowing to build and
    test the distribution is now available for download.</li>

<li>Feature: emulation of UncaughtExceptionHandler, in class
    <a href="doc/api/edu/emory/mathcs/backport/java/util/concurrent/helpers/ThreadHelpers.html">ThreadHelpers</a>.</li>

<li>Documentation: improved, more consistent and accurate javadoc.</li>

<li>Bugfix: NoClassDefFoundError when using nanoTime() on Java prior to 1.4.2.
    Thanks to Gabriel Wolosin for reporting this bug.</li>

<li>Bugfix: deadlocks in ConcurrentLinkedQueue when drainTo() or clear() was
    invoked when there was blocked put(). Thanks to Jean Morissette for
    reporting this bug.</li>

<li>Bugfix: minor glitch in Utils.nanoTime() would cause timer to lose
    accuracy, about 1ns every 11 days, if JVM was running continuously.
    (Note: as it turned out, the fix itself had a bug; see the log for 
    version 1.1)</li>
