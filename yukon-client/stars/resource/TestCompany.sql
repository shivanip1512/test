Create energy company default user in DBEditor!!!
As far as what I concern, an EnergyCompany role must be assigned to this "user". The role hasn't been checked into cvs yet, it'll be defined in com.cannontech.roles.yukon.EnergyCompanyRole.

A default route id must also be attached to this user. This is what I figured out how it should be done:
First, create a load group w/ serial# set to 0, and route set to whatever you want to use.
Then, create a macro group to include this group (you can also add other groups for a CI cusotmer, but I don't think we need to here)
Last, add the mapping b/w the user and the macro group in the OperatorSerialGroup table.
