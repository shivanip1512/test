/**
 * Base implementation of an Event. Sub classes should implement {@link #notifyHandler(Object, Object, EventHandler)
 * notifyHandler} to complete the event notifying functionality. Event specialization goes in pair with the
 * corresponding EventHandler interface implementation. Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * 
 * public class MyEvent extends EventBase<Thread, String, MyEventHandler> {
 *     @Override
 *     protected void notifyHandler(Thread source, String message, MyEventHandler handler) {
 *         handler.onMyEvent(connection, state);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * public interface MyEventHandler extends EventHandler {
 *     void onMyEvent(Thread source, String message);
 * }
 * 
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This class is thread safe. When fired, an Event will notify each of the handlers that where registered at the time of
 * the {@code fire} Method call. During execution of the event handling process, handlers can be (un)registered without
 * affecting the ongoing handling process. Any modification of the registered Handlers list during the handling process
 * will only be effective on the next event firing.
 * @param <S> The type of the source of the event (the object type that fires the event)
 * @param <A> The type of the argument passed along when an Event is fired
 * @param <T> The type of handler that can register to and handle this Event.
