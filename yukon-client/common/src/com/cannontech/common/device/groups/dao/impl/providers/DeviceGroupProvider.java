/**
 * This is the standard interface that all DeviceGroup providers must implement.
 * Implementers of this interface can extend the DeviceGroupProviderBase to reduce
 * the number of methods that must be implemented (all though for best performance,
 * each method will most likely need to be implemented individually). Throughout this 
 * interface, there is a consistent naming convention that must be followed if new 
 * methods are added. This convention is best illustrated by looking at the two 
 * most important methods:
 * 
 *    getDevices(DeviceGroup group)
 *    getChildDevices(DeviceGroup group)
 *    
 * The method with the word "child" in it should only return devices that are 
 * direct children of the given group. In this context, "child" and "direct child"
 * are used interchangeably and are assumed to mean there are no additional group
 * layers between the device and the group. The other method, getDevices, is
 * meant to work in a recursive fashion and should not only return everything
 * returned by getChildDevices, but also every device contained in a sub group
 * of group. In other words, it returns all of the devices that are descendants
 * of group.
 * 
 * For example, if device A is contained in group /foo/bar, the following
 * would be true (assumes String -> DeviceGroup conversion):
 * 
 *    getDevices(/foo).contains(A);
 *    getChildDevices(/foo).contains(A) == false;
 *    getDevices(/foo/bar).contains(A);
 *    getChildDevices(/foo/bar).contains(A);
 *    
 * Most of the methods in this interface are expected to operate on a "base" 
 * (which is implicit if they just accept a group). At first this may seem 
 * strange, but it is integral to the whole provider delegation model
 * that is used by the DeviceGroupProviderDaoMain class.
