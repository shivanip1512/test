        <troubleshooting>
            This is a bulk communications error typically associated with systems using direct radio
            communications between the master station and a targeted device such as a CCU, RTU or
            dial up meter.
            Communication timing setup usually plays a role in troubleshooting this problem.

        <troubleshooting>
            This is a data validation error associated with the frozen peak demand's timestamp
            falling outside the range expected by the master station.
            This range is defined as greater than the last frozen peak demand reading archived in the database
            and less than the timestamp of the most recent freeze command sent to the device.
            This error typically occurs if the device missed an attempted freeze of the registers.
