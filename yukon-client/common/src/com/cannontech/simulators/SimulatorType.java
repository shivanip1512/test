/**
 * Types of simulators run in the Yukon simulator service, with two exceptions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>SIMULATOR_STARTUP is not a type of simulator, but it is used to differentiate SimulatorStartupSettings requests from other simulator
 * requests. Do not try to upload settings for the SIMULATOR_STARTUP type to the YukonSimulatorSettings table. This will not work because
 * there are no entries for of type SIMULATOR_STARTUP in the YukonSimulatorSettingsKey enum.</li>
 * 
 * <li>FIELD_SIMULATOR is also not a simulator run inside the Yukon simulator service, but transfers messages to the C++ Field Simulator 
 * service to provide it with Web UI control.</li>
 * </ul>
