This folder is meant to hold code, scripts, snippets, directions, ... whatever someone found useful and wants to make available to the rest of the team.

Please try to put items in their own folders and include a README.txt file in those folders describing what it is, how it is meant to be used, what it does for you, and maybe sample artifacts of input and/or output.

Also put your stuff into the respective project it works with.
