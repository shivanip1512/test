<ol start=3
	style="list-style: decimal;"
	type=1>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p>The Geographical addressing information can be 
 changed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Geographical Addressing</span> 
 area.</p></li>

			class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The Service Provider 
 ID address of the load group can be changed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPID</span> 
 text box. The Service Provider ID address is sent with all group address 
 messages and is used to identify the service provider/owner utility. Valid 
 values are 1 to 65,534.</p></li>
		
		<li style="list-style: lower-alpha;"
			type=a
			class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The Geographical 
 address of the load group can be changed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">GEO</span> 
 text box. The Geographical address identifies a desired geographical area, 
 determined by the utility. Valid values are 1 to 65,534.</p></li>
		
		<li style="list-style: lower-alpha;"

 of the load group can be changed by clicking the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Set 
 Feeder Address</span> button and selecting the check boxes of the bits 
 to use. The Feeder address is typically used to identify the utility feeder 
 by which the load is fed. This is normally combined with the Substation 
 address, but it can be used alone. Each bit in this address represents 
 a feeder, which allows multiple feeders to be targeted with a single message.</p></li>
		
		<li style="list-style: lower-alpha;"
			type=a
			class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The Zip address

		<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The program address 
 can be changed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Program</span> 
 text box. The Program address is used to target specific loads. Field 
 devices that control multiple loads contain a separate program address 
 for each load. Valid values are 1 to 254.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 9px;">The splinter address 
 can be changed in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Splinter</span> 
 text box. The Splinter address is used to target a subset of the loads 
 targeted by the Program address. Field devices that control multiple loads 
 contain a separate splinter address for each load. Valid values are 1 
 to 254.</p></li>
	</ol>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p style="margin-bottom: 9px;">If the Program or
