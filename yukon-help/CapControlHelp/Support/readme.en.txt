The XML+XSL template produces XML that can be displayed
in browsers that support the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL).
The default XSL rules included with the template transform the 
generated XML into an HTML result set for display in IE5 or later,
however, they can easily be customized for other purposes if desired.

For more information on using and customizing projects created
from this template, please see the Template Guide section in
the online help.
