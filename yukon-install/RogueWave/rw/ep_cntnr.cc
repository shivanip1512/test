/* 
 *  PLEASE NOTE THE ABNORMAL STRUCTURE OF THIS FILE
 *
 *  The file has two major sections. The first section (between the #ifdef and
 *  the #endif for RW_SHUT_INLINES_GUARD_OFF...) contains templated class
 *  member functions which are expressed in such a way that they can be included
 *  either from within a class body or as "inlines" from outside the class body.
 *  The "INLINES_GAURD" assures that they are never seen both ways.
 *
 *  The second section of this file (between the #ifndef and the #endif of the
 *  macro RW_GET_INLINES_FOR_CLASS BODY contains the remaining templated class
 *  member functions which can only be seen from outside the class body.
 *
 *  Please modify or add new member definitions to this file with this scheme in
 *  mind. Placing new members in the wrong section will most assuredly break this
 *  scheme. If members can ever be seen from within a class body they must be placed
 *  in the first section.
 *
 *  NOTE: This scheme is commented in greatest detail in files slist.cc and slist.h.
 */


/*  
 *  This section of the include file is for members that might in some cases be 
 *  included from within their own class bodies.  Their function signatures and 
 *  template designators are constructed with macros whose expansion depends
 *  upon the macro RW_GET_INLINES_FOR_CLASS_BODY. (see below)
 *
 *  The guard RW_SHUT_INLINES_GUARD_OFF__SLIST_CC helps to assure that the
 *  compiler will NOT see this section twice, once from within a class body
 *  and once from outside the class.
