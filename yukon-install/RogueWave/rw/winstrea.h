 ***************************************************************************
 *
 * Under Windows, note the near similarity of the two constructors
 *
 *      RWCLIPstreambuf(int N);         // Dynamic.  Initial allocation of "N"
 *      RWCLIPstreambuf(HANDLE hMem);   // Static.   Use memory "hMem".
 *
 * This is because "HANDLE" has been typedef'd to "unsigned int", an
 * unfortunate consequence of Window's generally poor type checking.
 * Yet, the two constructors have vastly different semantics.
 * 
 * It is for this reason that an extra dummy argument was added to
 * the first of these constructors:
 *
 *      RWCLIPstreambuf(int N, int);    // 2'nd argument ignored.
 *
 * This dummy argument is ignored.

 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2007/02/16 16:54:09  jdayton
 * Adding current RogueWave (yes, DST patched) files so that the build process can continue to move away from requiring mapped network drive locations for its needed files...

 * Replace tabs with spaces, per Rogue Wave standard.
 *
 * Revision 7.3  1995/12/05 23:07:08  pearson
 * Remove ZTC ifdef
 *
 * Revision 7.2  1995/09/05 21:34:37  jims
 * Use new copyright macro
 *
 * Revision 7.1  1994/10/16  03:13:08  josh

 * Revision 2.3  1994/03/18  18:42:16  jims
 * Override virtual member function sync() in RWCLIPStreambuf
 *
 * Revision 2.2  1993/09/10  02:56:53  keffer
 * Switched RCS idents to avoid spurious diffs
 *
 * Revision 2.0  1992/10/23  03:27:32  keffer
