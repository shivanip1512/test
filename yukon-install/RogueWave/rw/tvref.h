 ***************************************************************************
 *
 * Although this array could be used by the end user it is really intended
 * to be the reference part of a reference counted array.  It uses
 * pure copy semantics and hence is relatively slow.  
 *
 * It inherits from RWReference and hence contains a reference count.
 * This is used to implement copy-on-write reference counting as was
 * done with class RWTValVirtualArray<T>.
 *
 * Assumes that T has:
 *   - well-defined copy constructor (T::T(const T&) or equiv.);
 *   - well-defined assignment operator (T::operator=(const T&) or equiv.).
 *
 * Note that the location in physical memory of a particular index 
 * of the array can change from invocation to invocation.  Hence,
 * the address of an element should never be taken.
