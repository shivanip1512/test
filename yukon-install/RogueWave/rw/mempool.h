/*
 * This class maintains a pool of free memory allocations for small objects.
 * Objects inheriting from it will be managed by it.  It can greatly improve
 * the performance of objects that are rapidly allocated and deleted, such
 * as nodes in a linked list or binary tree.  It can also help memory
 * fragmentation.
 *
 * Two static variables affect its performance:
 *
 *  RWMAXPOOLS:     The number of different sizes managed.  The
 *                  default (5) will manage objects with sizes
 *                  from 1 to 10 bytes big.  Objects bigger than this
 *                  will be handled by the operating system.
 *
 *  RWPOOLSIZE:     The maximum number of objects retained within a size class.
 *                  Excess objects are returned to the operating system.
