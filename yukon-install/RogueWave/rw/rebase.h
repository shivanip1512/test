// RWREBaseClass

//  Stores enums shared by both RWTRegularExpression
//  and RWTRegularExpresssionImp.
//
//  This is inherited by both RWTRegularExpression and RWTRegularExpressionImp
//  because RWTRegularExpressionImp uses some enums that are declared in
//  RWTRegularExpression but RWTRegularExpression has a member of type
//  RWTRegularExpressionImp. This can lead to a "chicken and egg" situation
//  that can confuse some compilers; hence this class.
