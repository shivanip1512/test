 ***************************************************************************
 *
 * To use, derive a class from RWBench including a doLoop(unsigned long) 
 * function, and a what() function (if you plan to use report()).  
 * The doLoop(unsigned long N) function should perform N operations of
 * the type you are trying to benchmark.  RWBench will call this function
 * over and over again until "duration" time has elapsed.  Then it will sum
 * the total number of operations performed.
 *
 * To run, construct an object then call go().  Then call report() to get
 * a summary.  You can call ops() outerLoops(), etc. for more detail.
 *
 * If you wish to correct for overhead, then provide an idleLoop() function
 * which does non-benchmark related calculations.
 *
