                     ********************
                  ****  Microsoft VC++  ****

                     ********************
The Software Parts Manager does not create a Borland version of the odbc32.lib,
so this step needs to be done manually. For example, assuming spm is installed
at c:\spm

cd c:\spm\workspaces\BorlandCPP_Builder30\15s\lib
implib odbc32.lib %ODBC%\dll\odbc32.dll

where odbc32.dll is the dll distributed from Microsoft in the odbc sdk.

                     ************************
When using the HP aCC compiler, you may encounter a variety of compiler
warnings or "future errors" in your code, or very occasionally in ours.
While porting our code, we encountered the warnings shown below.

 
 * Warning 740: ... # The cast between 'DerivedClass &' and
   'BaseClass&' is performed as a 'reinterpret_cast'.  This operation
   is non-portable and potentially unsafe.
     This warning is generated by C-style casts in code like:
        return (BaseClass &)derivedClassReference;
     It is also generated by use of reinterpret_cast itself.  If you
     feel (as we do) that the compiler should not default to warn
     about legal code, you might wish to let HP hear your view.  You
     can turn off the warning by passing +W740 to the compiler.

 * Warning 749: ... # Another C-Style casting issue. The cast between
     'type1' and 'type2' is performed as a 'reinterpret_cast'. This
     operation is non-portable and potentially unsafe.

2. OS-specific notes:
---------------------

=========================
3. Driver Specific Notes:
-------------------------
One of the challenges (and frustrations) of using ODBC is reconciling the
different behavior of various ODBC drivers. This version of the ODBC Access
library has been tested extensively using Microsoft's 32 bit driver for SQL
Server for use under NT.  Under UNIX, the access library has been tested with
the Merant 3.5 Oracle 8 driver against an Oracle 8.0.5 server and with the 
Merant 3.5 Sybase 11 driver against an Sybase 11.5 server.

The following anomilies have appeared during testing of the current and prior
releases of the ODBC access library:
 
a) When using Microsoft's 32 bit driver for SQL Server, repeated calls to 
   RWDBBulkInserter::execute() through the same instance result in a 
   segmentation fault in SQLParse().

b) The function call RWDBTable::schema() for Sybase tables containing columns
   of type numeric, money, or smallmoney returns erroneous results. The columns
   of the above mentioned types are ignored and don't show up in the returned
   RWDBSchema.

c) The function call RWDBCursor::updateRow() for Sybase tables containing
   columns of type numeric, money, or smallmoney returns erroneous results.
   The function returns a RWDBStatus of RWDBStatus::ok but the row is in
   fact not updated.

d) Transactions using the SQL Server Driver with Sybase System 10 are broken.
   The problem is that an implicit call to SET TEXT_SIZE is issued. This is
   considered DDL which can not be mixed with the DML making up the
   transaction. Tutorial 7 highlights this problem.

e) Insert statements taking a query-specification, as opposed to a
   VALUES list is not supported by the Intersolv's Flat file drivers.

f) Correlated subqueries using the Paradox driver return an empty result set.

g) The LEFT OUTER JOIN statement where we are given two tables A and B
   should "preserve" rows from A, and generates NULL rows for B. But
   the opposite is true; Rows from B are preserved and NULLS generated for A.

h) The following forms of SQL statements aren't supported by the Paradox driver.

   (select X UNION select Y) order by 1  // The problem is with the parenthesis.

   select X GROUP BY ( digit )           // Causes a GPF. Use column name instead.

i) The tutorial t6 doesn't work with MicroSoft's SIMBA.DLL. The problem
   is the GROUP BY <integer-value> that DBTools.h++ generates is not handled
   properly.

j) Microsoft's 32 bit driver for SQL Server ignores the database argument passed
   to the RWDBManager's database() function. Instead the database associated
   with the RWDBDatabase object returned by the database() function will be the
   default database for the user.

   RWDBStoredProc::exists() will fail if the database argument passed  to
   RWDBManager::database() is different then the default database.

k) RWDecimalPortable can't be use as arguments to stored procedures when using
   Microsoft's 32 bit driver for SQL Server. Execution will fail with a "Driver
   not capable" message.

l) When using Microsoft's 32 bit driver for SQL Server prior to version 3.5,
   Output parameters are not supported. Executing procedures which both accept 
   output parameters and returns a result set is particularly unstable.

m) DB2 specific types like BLOB(k), GRAPHICS(k) are not supported. 

n) Visigenic driver for Sybase SQL Server 10:
  1)  On HP-UX 10, SQLGetData() fails to retrieve values from columns of type 
      real with SQL C type SQL_C_FLOAT, however the function return value is 
      SQL_SUCCESS.  So retrieving values from columns of type real using
          RWDBReader& operator >> (float& value)  fails.
      The work around is to use 
          RWDBReader& operator >> (double& value) 

  2) Stored procedure name returned from SQLProcedures() is concatenated with 
     ";" plus a number. As a result, RWDBStoredProc::exists() will return 
     FALSE on an existing stored procedure.

  3) Positioned delete and update through cursors didn't work.

  4) String Insertion fails if a string has an embedded double quote
     leading an embedded single quote.  The driver error returned is
     [Visigenic][ODBC Sybase driver]Wrong number of parameters.

4. Known difficulties in this release
-------------------------------------
As of the shipping date, the following were unresolved:

ID      Description
--      -----------
11472   We have seen problems, with the insertion of RWDate and RWDBDatetime,
        using RWDBBoundExpresions, with the Merant Informix ODBC Driver.

=================================
5.  Changes from previous release, not documented elsewhere:
---------------------------------

  Maintenance release.
 
3.1.3 -> 3.1.4

	On PC:	old name: db<xx>lib.obj		new name: rw<libtype><buildtype>.obj

	Where xx is the place holder for the first two characters of the access library's 
	<libtype> variable listed in the online DBTools.h++ Build Guide, section 2.2.2, 
	Table 6 "Possible values for <libtype>".
