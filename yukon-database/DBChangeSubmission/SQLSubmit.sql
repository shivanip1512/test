/*New issue, check YUK-4334 for reference */
NEED TO CHECK TO SEE WHETHER THE USERPAOWNER TO USERPAOPERMISSION TRANSITION IN THE 3.4_0.sql file
is working correctly to move the default route group mapping for STARS energy companies.

If a default route is not loading correctly in STARS, then run the following query:
insert into UserPaoPermission (UserPaoPermissionID, UserID, PaoID, Permission) select 0, ec.userID, macro.OwnerID, 'allow LM visibility'
from EnergyCompany ec, LMGroupExpressCom exc, GenericMacro macro 
where macro.MacroType = 'GROUP' and macro.ChildID = exc.LMGroupID and exc.SerialNumber = '0' and ec.EnergyCompanyID = 0;

If an ID is returned, then the mapping failed and the default route is not correctly saved.

There are several questions we need to answer on this issue, so this can stay open for awhile.
